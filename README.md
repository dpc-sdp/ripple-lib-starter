# Ripple component library starter

This repo is a template for creating new components using the [Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple-framework) design system (version 2.0).

It is meant to be a reference implementation for creating your own components that extend Ripple. 

Ripple is maintained by the Single Digital Presence (SDP) team with Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC) of the Victorian state government.
